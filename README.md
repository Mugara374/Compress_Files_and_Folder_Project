# How to run the our program's code.
Our program's code is saved in a Python file called compress.py and can be run using a Python interpreter. The program will prompt the users to enter the path of the folder to compress and the desired compress type (zip, tar, tgz). After the compression process, the program will display a message indicating the success or failure of the compression.

Feel free to try the app and visit our github accounts for more projects!
